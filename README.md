### Hi there I'm Elizabeth ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working with Angular at Ving! Using Bitbucket... so I'm committing I promise, just not here :(

I am interested in learning React and Swift. 

I am also a multi media artist, ranging from digital paintings to bug taxidermy displays. 

Nice to meet you!
